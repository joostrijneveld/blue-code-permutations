Blue code permutations
======================

This repository contains a Python script that is able to find the encryption permutation that was used to encrypt two telegrams, encrypted with the Blue Code. It requires a known encryption figure.

A folder with telegrams is included that can be used to find such permutations, several of which do indeed produce a permutation (see the comment at the top of the code). A directory with plaintext telegrams is also included, used by the script to build up the memory.

The initial version of this program was included in my Bachelor thesis in June 2013.
